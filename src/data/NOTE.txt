// HTTP requests sent by JavaScript code are performed asynchronously. This doesnâ€™t fit well with the default
// behavior of the Redux data store, which responds to changes only when an action is processed by a reducer.
// Redux data stores can be extended to support asynchronous operations using a middleware function, which
// inspects the actions that are sent to the data store and alters them before they are processed.

/* PAGINATION */
// json-server supports pagination through query strings 
// http://localhost:3500/api/products?category_like=watersports&_page=2&_limit=3&_sort=name
// The query string for this URL asks the web service to return a page of products from a specific category.
// It ask the webservice to return the second page containing three products from the set that have a category value of watersports, sorted by name property,

// _page === selects the page number
// _limit === selects the page size
// _sort === specifies the property by which the objects will be sorted before being paginated
// category_like === filters the result to include only those category property matches the field value, if ommited, products from all category will be selected.


// The Axios package will use the parameters to add query string to the request URL.
