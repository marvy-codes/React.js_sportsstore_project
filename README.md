# React.js_sportsstore_project
This project is a React16 follow up project of Adam freeman.
It explains basic functions of react to more complex features, from using placeholder data, to consuming a RESTful webservice, it also has features for
checking out of the store, also administrations, authentication and deployment.
Explaining concepts like Redux, React life cycle, React-dom and other core react packeges used to set up a complete working react web application.
The project really gives me a feel of what react development feels like.
